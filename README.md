# test for machine_learning
## case_appreal - apply Knn and Random Forests to predict the stock decrease on online shop
#### Summary
- ML-KNN, the results give a proper accurate rate. However, the decision boundary is not clear so change the dimensions or test other models will be better.
- ML-RT, we can apply more dimensions to get more competed predictive and complicated results.
- promoted/new arrival features can also be created as the dimensons to measure the predictions
- if inlcudes user session, demographic and transaction data, we can calssify user attributions by different feaatures, linking to the product ategories. 

## case_car
apply Random Forests to predict the driver completed rate.
